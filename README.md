# 🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe (React)

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **React** — nothing fancy, just a fun little side project made out of boredom.

## ⚙️ Features

- Basic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid
- X and O turns
- Win detection
- Draw detection
- Play Again (reset) button

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo and run the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aaditya514/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
cd Tic-Tac-Toe
npm install
npm run dev
```

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (optional) set up.

## 📁 Tech Stack

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast dev build

No external styling libraries or frameworks used — pure Tailwind CSS (optional) or basic CSS classes.

## 🤷‍♂️ Why?

Honestly? I was bored.  
Built it just for fun to refresh React basics.

## 📦 Coming Soon

- Highlighting the winning row
- Score tracking
- Better mobile layout
- VS AI mode (maybe 👀)
